# MCC-Attendance-Tracker V2

This is the project that i'm working on during my internship. The purpose of this project is to provide a web based attendance tracker website which to track the interns
time records and calculation for the remaining hours of each intern.

Specifically this web based application has its features that:

1. allows the intern supervisor to manage the important university documents needed in every intern.
2. allows the intern supervisor to add and deduct the hours left, change role of the intern, assign an intern to a team , and approval of the intern's offboarding request.
3. allows the HR staff to set a webinar event.

To set up this web:

read and follow the instruction at readme.txt that can found at database folder
use this following credentials.

Admin account username: admin0101@gmail.com password: admin0101

Staff account username: staff0101@gmail.com password: staff0101

You can register a user or intern account directly to the system but make sure to set the SMTP first which can be found at "SMTP GUIDE" tab but you need to log in as an admin account.
(Note! SMTP is needed before registering an account for its status and provide generated password after it is approved).
